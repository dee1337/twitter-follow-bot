#Twitter Follow Bot

A Python bot that can automatically follow users and favorite/RT tweets associated with a specific search query on Twitter. Also has the ability to unfollow all users not currently following you back.

## my experience with a non-optimized first implementation logic (not available in this repo):
klout score 52 in 6 days with some hours downtime, because i forgot to implement exception handling

##Disclaimer

I hold no liability for what you do with this script or what happens to you by using this script. Abusing this script *can* get you banned from Twitter, so make sure to read up on proper usage of the Twitter API.

##Would you like me to run this bot for you?

I have a server running this bot 24/7, and can run it for any Twitter account. If you'd like to have a version of this bot running for your account so you can gain more followers, favorite certain Twitter content, etc., contact me: http://www.randalolson.com/contact/

Please be sure to include relevant information about yourself and your Twitter account, including your background, the purpose of your Twitter account, what kind of content you're interested in targeting, etc.

##Dependencies

You will need to install Python's [python-twitter](https://code.google.com/p/python-twitter/) library first:

    easy_install twitter
    
You will also need to create an app account on https://dev.twitter.com/apps

1. Sign in with your Twitter account
2. Create a new app account
3. Modify the settings for that app account to allow read & write
4. Generate a new OAuth token with those permissions
5. Manually edit this script and put those tokens in the script

##Usage

This bot has several functions for programmatically interacting with Twitter:

####Automatically follow any users that tweet something with a specific phrase

    from twitter_follow_bot import auto_follow
  
    auto_follow("phrase")
    
You can also search based on hashtags.
  
By default, the bot looks up the 100 most recent tweets. You can change this number with the `count` parameter:

    from twitter_follow_bot import auto_follow
  
    auto_follow("phrase", count=1000)
    
####Automatically follow any users that have followed you

    from twitter_follow_bot import auto_follow_followers
    
    auto_follow_followers()

####Automatically favorite any tweets that have a specific phrase

    from twitter_follow_bot import auto_fav
  
    auto_fav("phrase", count=1000)
    
####Automatically retweet any tweets that have a specific phrase

    from twitter_follow_bot import auto_rt
  
    auto_rt("phrase", count=1000)

####Automatically unfollow any users that have not followed you back (with exceptions that you can set)

    from twitter_follow_bot import auto_unfollow_nonfollowers
  
    auto_unfollow_nonfollowers()
  
You will need to manually edit the code if you want to add special users that you will keep following even if they don't follow you back.
